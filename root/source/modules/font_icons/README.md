You won't want to put these icons into a site unnecessarily, but the solution provided by font awesome gives a great way to deploy icons that are accessible, have IE 7 solutions and are/can be scaleable and responsive.

They don't replace icons given in design mockups, but in many cases where a monochrome icon is required a font icon can be used.

The solution is ideal replacement for the sprite map approach used by many rasterised icon libraries with the added benefit of being fully scaleable to any size and most browsers.

IE 7 Support
------------

There is an IE 7 workaround, but right now you'll need to manually copy, or add @import commands for SASS for the IE 7 css file from this modules CSS directory.
