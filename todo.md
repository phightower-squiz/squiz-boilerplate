# To Dos

## Core

The following is a list of core changes to add

* Possibly mobile/medium/wide show/hide styles

## Modules

The following is a list of modules that need have solutions created

Necessary:
* Contact Details (hCard microformat)
* Pagination (Matrix lists & search)
* Pagination (Funnelback)
* Date chooser/picker
* On/Off Switcher
* Dictionary Search box?
* Parallax
* "Add this" widget

Nice to haves:
* Clickable AU map as scalable SVG
* Lazy Load resources (long pages with images)

Other Features:
* Check for console.logs in the code, prevent build

Feedback notes:
* git console vs cygwin - cygwin issues?

Bugs:
* Keyboard tab navigation in LTE IE8
* Nav dropdown/Mega - doesn't seem to have JS delay
* Tabs auto hash selection is really annoying. Look for a way to stop the default behaviour.

Limitations:
* Doesn't support pushing modules into separate files (e.g. only slideshow appears on the homepage) - requires manual workarounds.
