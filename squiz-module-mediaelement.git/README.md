## Overview

Installing media element requires some customisation to the paths in the CSS in order to resolve them to the actual svg and png images used in the player. This module is a static copy of that CSS resolved for the Boilerplate, but dynamically referenced JS.

If you want to update the CSS for this module you will need to follow the same process of copying the CSS from the bower component along with the images, swf and xap files.
