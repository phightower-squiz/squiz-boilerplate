> Table enhancement with sorting, pagination and search using the [DataTables][] jQuery plugin

**Note:** The [DataTables][] plugin itself is very well documented with extensive [examples](http://datatables.net/examples).

## Overview

Data tables comes with it's own CSS which is included auto magically via the `import/_css.html` file. You may wish to customise this which I'd recommend adding into the global/medium/wide CSS files.
