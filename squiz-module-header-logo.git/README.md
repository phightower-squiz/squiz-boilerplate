> Header logo pattern for boilerplate

## Overview

A common pattern with many websites is to include a logo that is linked back to the homepage/root of the site. This super simple pattern shows how that can be implemented in the boilerplate using a background image and visually hidden alternate text.

```html
<a href="/" class="header-logo"><span class="visuallyhidden">Site Name</span></a>
```
