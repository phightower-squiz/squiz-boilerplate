> Styling and validation for Squiz Matrix custom form accessible output. Some form styles taken from [wtforms](http://wtfforms.com/) for greater stylistic control over checkboxes, radio buttons and select boxes.

## Usage

Make sure for the custom forms you wish to style in Matrix that you have the `Accessible Format` option set to *Yes* otherwise the form will output tabular content and most of the styling in this module will be ignored.

**Note:** This is just a starting point to help reduce the amount of work that has to be done to style up a Matrix form.
